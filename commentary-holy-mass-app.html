        <p>The thought of his being about to appear before his God excites in the soul of the Priest a lively sentiment of compunction. He cannot go further in the holy Sacrifice without confessing, and publicly, that he is a sinner, and deserves not the grace he is about to receive. Listen, with respect, to this confession of God&rsquo;s Minister, and earnestly ask our Lord to show mercy to him; for the Priest is your Father: he is answerable for your salvation, for which he every day risks his own. When he has finished, unite with the Servers, or the Sacred Ministers, in this prayer:</p>

        </table>
        <p>If it be a high Mass at which you are assisting, the Priest incenses the Altar in a most solemn manner; and this white cloud which you see ascending from every part of the Altar, signifies the prayer of the Church, who addresses herself to Jesus Christ; and which this Divine Mediator then causes to ascend, united with his own, to the throne of the majesty of his Father.</p>
        <p>The Priest then says the Introit. It is a solemn opening-Anthem, in which the Church gives expression to the sentiments which fill <i> her heart</i>.</p>
        <p>It is followed by nine exclamations which are even more earnest, for they ask for mercy. In addressing them to God, the Church unites herself with the nine Choirs of Angels, who are standing round the altar of Heaven, - one and the same with this before which you are kneeling.</p>

        <p>Then mingling his voice with that of the heavenly host, the Priest intones the sublime Canticle of Bethlehem, which announces <i>Glory to God, and peace to men. </i> Instructed by the revelations of God, the Church continues, in her own words, the Hymn of the Angels.</p>
        <p>THE ANGELIC HYMN.</p>
        <table border="1" width="100%">
        <tbody>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The Priest turns towards the people, and again salutes them, as it were to make sure of their pious attention to the sublime act, for which all this is but the preparation.</p>
        <p>Then follows the <i>Collect </i>or <i>Prayer</i>, in which the Church formally expresses to the divine Majesty the special intentions she has in the Mass which is being celebrated. You may unite in this prayer, by reciting with the Priest the Collects which you will find in their proper places: but on no account omit to join, with the Server of the Mass, in answering <i>Amen</i>.</p>
        <p>The Priest then reads the <i>Epistle</i>, which is, generally, a portion of one or other of the Epistles of the Apostles, or a passage from some Book of the Old Testament. Whilst it is being read, give thanks to that God, who not satisfied with having spoken to us at sundry times by his messengers, deigned at last to speak unto us by his well-beloved Son! (Heb. i. 2.)</p>
        <p>The <i> Gradual</i> is a formula of prayer intermediate between the Epistle and Gospel. It again brings to our attention the sentiments which were expressed in the Introit. Read it with devotion, so as to get more and more into the spirit of the mystery proposed to you this day by the Church.</p>
        <p>The <i>Alleluia</i> is like a thrill of joy, which seizes the soul of the Church, and makes her exult. Let us whilst it is being said, unite with the holy Angels, who are, for all eternity, making heaven resound with that song, which we, on earth, are permitted to attempt. At certain seasons the Tract takes the place of the Alleluia verse.</p>
        <p>The time is come for the Gospel to be read. The Gospel is the written word; our hearing it will prepare us for the Word, who is our Victim and our Food. If it be a High Mass, the Deacon prepares to fulfil his noble office, that of announcing the Good Tidings of Salvation. He prays God, to cleanse his heart and lips. Then kneeling, he asks the Priest&rsquo;s blessing; and having received it, he at once goes to the place where he is to sing the Gospel.</p>
        <p>As a preparation for hearing it worthily, you may thus say, together with the Priest and Deacon:</p>
        <table border="1" width="100%">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td  class="p-2" width="50%">Munda cor meum, ac labia mea, omnipotens Deus, qui labia Isaiae Prophetae calculo mundasti ignito: ita me tua grata miseratione dignare mundare, ut sanctum Evangelium tuum digne valeam nuntiare. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.<br /> Dominus sit in corde meo, et in labiis meis: ut digne et competenter annuntiem Evangelium suum: In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</td>
        <td  class="p-2" width="50%">Alas! these ears of&nbsp; mine are but too often defiled with the world&rsquo;s vain words; cleanse&nbsp; them, O Lord, that so I may hear the words of Eternal life, and treasure them in my heart. Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br /> Grant to thy ministers thy grace, that they may faithfully explain thy law; that so all, both pastors and flock, may be united to thee for ever, Amen.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>You will stand during the Gospel, as though you were waiting the orders of your Lord; and at the commencement, make the sign of the Cross on your forehead, lips, and breast; and say with the Server of the Mass</p>
        <table border="1" width="100%">
        <tbody>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Then listen to every word of the Priest or Deacon. Let your heart be ready and obedient. <i>Whilst my beloved was speaking, </i> says the Bride in the Canticle, <i>my soul melted within me.</i> Cantic. v. 6. If you have not such love as this, have at least the humble submission of Samuel, and say: Speak, Lord! thy servant heareth. 1 Kings iii. 10.</p>
        <p>At the end of the Gospel, answer with the Server of the Mass:</p>
        <table border="1" width="100%">

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>After the Gospel, if the Priest says the Symbol of Faith, the <i>Credo</i>, you will say it with him. Faith is that gift of God, without which we cannot please him. Let us then say with the Catholic Church, our Mother:</p>
        <p>THE NICENE CREED.</p>

        <p>The Priest and the people should now have their hearts ready: it is time to prepare the offering itself.</p>
        <p>See then, dear Christians! bread and wine are about to be offered to God, as being the noblest of inanimate creatures, since they are made for the nourishment of man; and yet that is but a poor material image of what they are destined to become in our Christian Sacrifice. Their substance will soon be changed into the very flesh and blood of Christ our Lord and God; of themselves nothing will remain but the appearances. Happy creatures, thus to yield up their own being, that God may take its place! We, too, are to undergo a like transformation, when, as the Apostle expresses it, <i> that which in us is mortal will be swallowed up by life. </i>2 Cor. v. 4.&nbsp; Until that happy change shall be realised, let us offer ourselves to God as often as we see the Bread and Wine presented to him in the Holy Sacrifice; and let us glorify Him, who by assuming our human nature has made us <i> partakers in the divine nature. </i>2 St. Pet. i. 4,</p>
        <p>The Priest again turns to the people with the usual salutation, as though he would warn them to redouble their attention. Let us read the Offertory with him, and when he offers the Host to God, let us unite with him and say:</p>

        <p>If it be a High Mass, the Priest, before proceeding any further with the Sacrifice, takes the thurible a second time. He first incenses the Bread and Wine which have just been offered, and then the altar itself; hereby inviting the Faithful to make their prayer, which is signified by the incense, more and more fervent, the nearer the solemn moment approaches. St. John tells us that the incense, which burns on the Altar in heaven, is made of <i> the Prayers of the Saints. </i> Let us share in those <i>prayers,</i> and with all the ardour of holy desires.</p>
        <p>But the thought of his own unworthiness becomes more intense than ever in the heart of the Priest. The public confession which he made at the foot of the altar, is not enough; he would now, at the altar itself, express to the people, in the language of a solemn rite, how far he knows himself to be from that spotless sanctity, wherewith he should approach to God. He washes his <i> hands.</i> Our hands signify our <i>works;</i> and the Priest, though by his priesthood he bear the office of Jesus Christ, is, by his works, but man. Seeing your Father thus humble himself, do you also make an act of humility, and say with him these verses of</p>
        <p>PSALM 25.</p>

        <p>He then concludes the Mass by reading the first fourteen verses of the Gospel according to St. John, which tell us of the eternity of the Word, and of the mercy which led him to take upon himself our <i> flesh,</i> and to <i> dwell among us.</i> Pray that you may be of the number of those, who <i>received him, </i> when he <i> came unto his own</i> people, and who, thereby, were made the <i>Sons of God.</i></p>

        <p>In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per ipsum facta sunt et sine ipso factum est nihil, quod factum est, in ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum: et lux in tenebris lucet, et tenebrae eam non comprehenderunt. Fuit homo missus a Deo, cui nomen erat Johannes. Hic venit in testimonium, ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine, ut omnes crederent per illum. Non erat ille lux, sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Erat lux vera, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum. In mundo erat, et mundus per ipsum factus est, et mundus eum non cognovit. In propria venit, et sui eum non receperunt. Quotquot autem receperunt eum, dedit eis potestatem filios Dei fieri, his, qui credunt in nomine ejus: qui non ex sanguinibus, neque ex voluntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt. Et Verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis: et vidimus gloriam ejus, gloriam quasi Unigeniti a Patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis.<br /> R. Deo gratias.</p>

        <td  class="p-2" width="50%">The beginning of the holy Gospel according to John.
        <p><i>Ch. I.</i></p>
        <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was made nothing that was made, in him was life, and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him. He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light. That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them he gave power to be made the sons of God; to them that believe in his name, who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw his glory, as it were the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<br /> R. Thanks be to God.</p>
